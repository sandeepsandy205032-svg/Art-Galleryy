    <h2>Tiger in a Tropical Storm (1891) by Henri Rousseau</h2>
    <p>
   Henri Rousseau started his artistic life on the periphery of famous artists and experts of the time. This was one of the nature artist’s early works and criticized by some reviewers as being overly juvenile. When it was originally shown in 1891, however, some art enthusiasts regarded the many distinct brilliant layers as one that merited appreciation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Subsequently, Rousseau would say that the tiger was ready to attack a group of adventurers. His use of a variety of green hues reflects the luxuriant, compelling character of the jungle. Since then, many art lovers have praised Rousseau’s work for taking a fresh look at the frequently depicted forest. He applied silver paint to symbolize rains that are rushing in with a very stiff gust. Rousseau’s work was controversial during his life, however, after his demise, he has ascended to the top of the list of painters who adored creating paintings of nature.
