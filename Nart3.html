    <h2>The Oxbow (1836) by Thomas Cole</h2>
    <p>
      Thomas Cole was a well-known nature artist who was born on February 1, 1801, in Lancashire, England. He was a founding partner of the Hudson River School, a US movement greatly influenced by Romantic painters’ work, and he is recognized as one of the finest painters of 19th-century America. Cole’s artwork is known for its representation of the American untamed scene. Cole was working on a historical series for Lumen Reed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cole was initially excited by the prospect, but as the long and slow process progressed, he became quiet and withdrawn, so Reed suggested that he take a rest from the installment and work on something he enjoyed more, such as his paintings of nature for the upcoming annual exhibition. Cole answered that he would finish the final painting in the series and show it, but Reed wished to wait until they could all be shown at the same time, so he encouraged Cole to paint this instead.
