    <h2>The Hay Wain (1821) by John Constable</h2>
    <p>
     John Constable came to prominence by depicting the beautiful nature that surrounded his house and is credited by art historians with redefining the style of painting nature. His artwork was so linked with the Dedham Vale region that it was renamed “Constable Country.” He never made a living from his work during his lifetime, but he earned widespread public and critical appreciation after his death.
    <p>
      It depicts a farm along the Stour River, which flows between the towns of Essex and Suffolk. The piece’s focal point is a huge wooden wagon being drawn by three horses across the River Stour. The scene shows a location near Flatford Mill, which belonged to his dad. The picture is widely recognized as one of history’s best Romantic landscape paintings.
